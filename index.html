  I'm a software engineer at Stripe working within the Core Infrastructure
  group. These days, my technical interests sit lower on the stack, primarily in
  ML infrastructure, distributed systems, and databases.

  I graduated from Harvard in 2024, where I studied computer science. In
  college, I spent a lot of time on database-related research (self-designing
  systems, hyperparamater optimization systems, and index partitioning
  algorithms) and was a teaching fellow for
  <a href="https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2023/#gsc.tab=0"
    >CS 61 (Systems Programming and Machine Organization)</a
  >. I also completed internships across the stack at Stripe, Meta, Lime, and
  Cisco.
