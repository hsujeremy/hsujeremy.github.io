  I'm a software engineer at Stripe in the Core Infrastructure group. These
  days, my technical interests sit lower on the stack, primarily in ML
  infrastructure, distributed systems, and databases.

  I fortunately get to see a lot of the above at Stripe. I currently work on the
  control plane for Stripe's document database fleet backing all public APIs,
  and previously worked on multiple projects at the foundational cloud
  infrastructure layer.

  I graduated from Harvard in 2024, where I studied computer science. In
  college, I spent a lot of time on database-related research (self-designing
  systems, hyperparamater optimization systems, and index partitioning
  algorithms) and was a teaching fellow for
  <a href="https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2023/#gsc.tab=0"
    >CS 61 (Systems Programming and Machine Organization)</a
  >. I also completed internships both at the product and infrastructure layers
  at Stripe, Meta, Lime, and Cisco.
