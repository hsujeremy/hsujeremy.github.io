<p>
  I'm a recent graduate from Harvard University, where I studied Computer
  Science with a focus on computer systems. Specifically, I found myself
  interested in distributed systems, operating systems, databases, and ML
  infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
  During college, I completed summer internships at
  <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> (infrastructure),
  <a href="https://about.facebook.com/meta">Meta</a> (full-stack), and
  <a href="https://www.li.me">Lime</a> (full-stack). I also took a gap year
  between my first and second years to intern at
  <a href="https://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a>
  (metrics and internal tooling).
</p>

<p>
  On campus, I got fairly involved in systems research (serverless computing,
  self-designing databases, and systems for ML), serving on the course staff for
  <a href="https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/site/2023/#gsc.tab=0">CS 61</a>, and
  designing and writing algorithms for
  <a href="https://datamatch.me">Datamatch</a>.
